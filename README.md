The goal of the study was to develop a predictive model to estimate the ordinal variable "damage_grade," which denotes the level of damage grade affected by earthquake. 
Exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, model creation, training, testing, and performance evaluation were among the processes that made up its framework.
